  whenToUse: "Before propose_layout: exact JSON shape, limits, worked examples.",
  body: `# Layout authoring

\`propose_layout\` takes \`{ name, summary?, data }\` where \`data\` is AgentSafeLayoutData. A
proposal is never applied automatically — the user reviews and applies it.

## Submit one complete proposal

Build the entire layout internally before showing anything to the user: choose every panel, finish
each panel's config, and assemble the complete mosaic tree. Call \`propose_layout\` exactly once
with that finished layout.

Never submit a skeleton, placeholder, or partial layout first and follow it with a fuller proposal.
If topic or panel availability is still unknown, inspect \`get_data_catalog\`.
Use the **Available panels** section of the system context instead of a half-built proposal to probe
what is available.

Only propose again within the same request when the user explicitly asked to revise a layout that
was already applied. Even then, submit one complete revised version at a time.

## Structure

\`\`\`json
{
  "configById": { "<panel-id>": { /* panel config */ } },
  "globalVariables": {},
  "userNodes": {},
  "playbackConfig": { "speed": 1 },
  "layout": "<mosaic tree>"
}
\`\`\`

\`configById\`, \`globalVariables\`, \`userNodes\`, and \`playbackConfig.speed\` are all required.
\`layout\` and \`version\` are optional but a layout without \`layout\` shows no panels. No other
top-level fields are accepted.

## Panel ids

Every id is \`<type>!<suffix>\`, where type is on the allowlist and suffix is any short unique
string (\`3D!main\`, \`Plot!imu\`).

Allowed types: ${ALLOWED_PANEL_TYPES.join(", ")}.

Three rules that are enforced and will reject the proposal:
1. Every id appearing in \`layout\` must have a \`configById\` entry.
2. Every \`configById\` entry must appear in \`layout\` — no orphans.
3. No id may appear twice in \`layout\`.

## Panel titles

Every panel config in a proposal must include \`lichtblickPanelTitle\`: a short description in the
user's language of what the panel is for ("Left front wheel speed", not "Plot"). The panel
toolbar shows this title instead of the panel type, so the user can tell panels apart at a
glance. Prefer the user's own words; never use a panel type name as the title.

Exceptions — these panels render a custom toolbar and do not display the title, so it may be
omitted:

- \`Table\`
- \`RawMessages\`
- \`RawMessagesVirtual\`

Extension panels (for example the robot visualization panels) should carry a title too; whether
it renders depends on the extension's toolbar, which is not visible in the panel inventory, so
write one anyway.

## Mosaic tree

A tree node is either a panel id string, or a split:

\`\`\`json
{ "direction": "row", "first": <node>, "second": <node>, "splitPercentage": 50 }
\`\`\`

\`direction\` is \`"row"\` (side by side) or \`"column"\` (stacked). \`splitPercentage\` is 0–100 and
gives the share taken by \`first\`. Only these four fields are allowed on a split node.

## Limits

At most ${String(AGENT_SAFE_LAYOUT_MAX_CONFIG_BY_ID_ENTRIES)} panels and a tree depth under
${String(AGENT_SAFE_LAYOUT_MAX_MOSAIC_DEPTH)}. Practical layouts use 2–5 panels; more than that is
harder to read than it is informative. Keep configs minimal — set what the user asked for and let
defaults handle the rest.

## Example: single 3D scene

\`\`\`json
{
  "configById": {
    "3D!main": { "lichtblickPanelTitle": "Scene", "topics": { "/points": { "visible": true }, "/tf": { "visible": true } } }
  },
  "globalVariables": {},
  "userNodes": {},
  "playbackConfig": { "speed": 1 },
  "layout": "3D!main"
}
\`\`\`

## Example: 3D beside a plot

\`\`\`json
{
  "configById": {
    "3D!scene": { "lichtblickPanelTitle": "Scene", "topics": { "/points": { "visible": true } } },
    "Plot!speed": {
      "lichtblickPanelTitle": "Forward speed",
      "paths": [
        { "value": "/odom.twist.twist.linear.x", "enabled": true, "timestampMethod": "receiveTime", "label": "vx" }
      ]
    }
  },
  "globalVariables": {},
  "userNodes": {},
  "playbackConfig": { "speed": 1 },
  "layout": { "direction": "row", "first": "3D!scene", "second": "Plot!speed", "splitPercentage": 60 }
}
\`\`\`

  "configById": {
    "Plot!battery": {
      "lichtblickPanelTitle": "Battery voltage",

## Layout pattern library

A proven starting point for common requests. Each pattern lists when it fits, a complete layout,
and suggested proportions. Panel counts and split percentages are **suggestions, not hard
limits** — the layouts below pass the same validation that \`propose_layout\` applies, and every
topic or path in them is a placeholder to replace from the loaded catalog.

All patterns use 2–4 panels and at most 3 levels of nesting, far inside the budgets listed under
"Budget boundaries" below. If no pattern fits, use one of the single- or two-panel examples above
and ask the user rather than stacking more panels.

### Robot debugging

**When to use**: the user is debugging motion, perception, or planning on a robot, and the
catalog has transform topics plus at least one renderable topic (point cloud, markers, path,
occupancy grid). Default to the quadruped panel unless the user names the humanoid or the
built-in 3D panel — see the robot-viz skill.

**What**: one dominant scene view with a signal column beside it. 3 panels: robot view, one
Plot, one StateTransitions. Suggested split: scene 60–70%, signal column 30–40% (Plot above,
StateTransitions below, 65/35 inside the column).

\`\`\`json
${JSON.stringify(ROBOT_DEBUG_LAYOUT, null, 2)}
\`\`\`

**Not a fit**: no transforms or renderable topics → propose a Plot-only layout or ask; user
wants the generic 3D panel → swap the robot panel for \`3D!scene\` and mark every topic
\`visible: true\`.

### Sensor monitoring

**When to use**: several camera topics (or one camera with multiple channels) plus numeric
signals (IMU, temperature, battery). Prefer adding \`calibrationTopic\` whenever camera
calibration exists — without it the Image panel draws no 3D overlays.

**What**: a camera wall with a numeric column. 4 panels: two Images, one Plot, one Gauge.
Suggested split: camera column 60–70% (two Images at 50/50), numeric column 30–40% (Plot above,
Gauge below). For compressed-video topics, reduce to a single video panel — decoding several
video streams at once degrades playback.

\`\`\`json
${JSON.stringify(SENSOR_MONITORING_LAYOUT, null, 2)}
\`\`\`

**Not a fit**: no image topics → drop to a numeric-only layout (Plot + Gauge); more than two
Gauges → use one Plot instead; more than three cameras → ask the user which camera matters most.

### Log troubleshooting

**When to use**: the user is investigating errors, warnings, or node behavior, and the catalog
has a topic with one of the exact Log schemas the RosOut panel accepts (see the panel-catalog
skill — \`convertibleTo\` does not qualify). Log filtering works for live and recorded data
alike.

**What**: the log list with correlated signals. 3 panels: RosOut, one Plot, one
StateTransitions. Suggested split: log 55–60% on top, signal row 40–45% below (Plot and
StateTransitions at 50/50).

\`\`\`json
${JSON.stringify(LOG_TROUBLESHOOTING_LAYOUT, null, 2)}
\`\`\`

**Not a fit**: no Log-schema topic → ask for the log topic or fall back to Plot +
StateTransitions; live data → Plot/StateTransitions click-to-seek is unavailable (recorded data
only) — say so instead of promising timeline navigation.

### Replay analysis

**When to use**: recorded data (bag, MCAP, ULog) and the user wants to walk through behavior,
find event times, or compare signals. Plot and StateTransitions support click-to-seek on
recorded data; the RawMessages panel shows the latest message for a topic (with optional diff
mode) — it has no per-message stepping.

**What**: a time-series comparison with a detail panel. 3 panels: Plot, StateTransitions,
RawMessages. Suggested split: Plot 45–50% on top, StateTransitions and RawMessages at 50/50
below.

\`\`\`json
${JSON.stringify(REPLAY_ANALYSIS_LAYOUT, null, 2)}
\`\`\`

**Not a fit**: live data → click-to-seek is unavailable; when the user wants to see the scene,
add a 3D or robot panel instead of a fourth analysis panel; object-list inspection → swap the
Plot for a Table (topicPath pointing at an object array).

### Budget boundaries

\`propose_layout\` data is validated against hard budgets, all exported from layoutSchema:

- At most ${String(AGENT_SAFE_LAYOUT_MAX_CONFIG_BY_ID_ENTRIES)} panels in \`configById\`.
- Mosaic tree depth under ${String(AGENT_SAFE_LAYOUT_MAX_MOSAIC_DEPTH)}.
- At most ${String(AGENT_SAFE_LAYOUT_MAX_COLLECTION_ENTRIES)} entries in any JSON collection.
- At most ${String(AGENT_SAFE_LAYOUT_MAX_GRAPH_DEPTH)} levels of nesting anywhere in the data.
- At most ${String(AGENT_SAFE_LAYOUT_MAX_GRAPH_NODES)} total values.
- Any single string at most ${String(AGENT_SAFE_LAYOUT_MAX_STRING_BYTES)} bytes.

The patterns above stay far below every budget (≤ 4 panels, ≤ 3 nesting levels), so following a
pattern cannot hit a budget by itself — only the paths and configs added on top of one can.

## Extending the layout the user has open

The workspace summary lists the open layout's panel ids (\`Plot!abc\`, ...) but not their
configurations, so you cannot reproduce existing panels. Give every panel in your proposal a
fresh id that does not collide with the listed ones.

Lichtblick compares the proposal with the open layout when the user applies it: a proposal that
is exactly the open layout plus new panels is added in place; anything else — and any proposal
that carries \`userNodes\` — is saved as a new layout. You do not control which happens, so say
"adds panels" or "new layout" only as the card shows it, and never claim the layout was applied.

## Before proposing

Load the message-path skill for every path you write. Build paths and topic names only from the loaded catalog — never from memory of what a robot
"usually" publishes. Load the panel-catalog skill if unsure which panel accepts a given schema, and
check the per-panel requirements there that validation does not enforce. Say briefly why the chosen
panels answer the user's question.`,
