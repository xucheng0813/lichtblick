  body: `# Reading loaded data and playback control

The tools \`read_messages\`, \`search_messages\`, and \`playback_control\` operate on the data
source currently loaded in the workspace. They cannot read anything that is not loaded, and they
cannot load data themselves — use \`open_data_source\` first and wait for catalog-ready.

## read_messages

Read messages of one topic in receive order.

\`read_messages({ topic, start?, end?, limit? })\` — a single JSON object:

- \`topic\`: a topic from the loaded catalog.
- \`start\`/\`end\`: optional time bounds — decimal nanoseconds (see Time format below).
- \`limit\`: 1–100 messages to return (default 100).

Example: \`read_messages({ topic: "/imu", limit: 20 })\`.

Size the time window from the topic's publish period: never narrower than 10× the period
(50 ms at minimum) — a 1 ms window just returns 0 messages. Prefer one wide window plus a
\`limit\` over many narrow windows: do not sweep second by second (68 separate reads); one wide
read answers faster and costs far fewer calls.

The scan is capped at 50,000 messages and the returned payloads at a byte budget; oversized
messages are summarized and the result is marked \`truncated\` when the budget runs out. Results
carry \`scanned\` so you know how much was looked at.

## search_messages

Search one topic for messages matching \`text\` (case-insensitive substring) and/or \`level\`
(one of \`debug\`, \`info\`, \`warn\`, \`error\`, \`fatal\`, \`unknown\`). At least one of the two is
required; when both are given they are ANDed. \`limit\` is 1–20 hits (default 20). The same
50,000-message scan cap and byte budgets apply.

Log schemas (\`foxglove_msgs/Log\`, \`rcl_interfaces/msg/Log\`, \`rosgraph_msgs/Log\` and their
aliases) are matched on the normalized message text and level. Other schemas are matched on the
serialized payload text.

Every hit reports \`receiveTimeNs\` — the seekable receive time. Use that time for seeking, not
the message-internal stamp.

## playback_control

\`playback_control({ action, time? })\` — a single JSON object:

- \`action: "seek"\` requires \`time\` (decimal nanoseconds). The requested time is clamped to the
  loaded data range; the tool returns the accepted clamped target as \`acceptedTimeNs\` and
  **optionally** \`previousTimeNs\` — the playback position before this seek, present only when
  the player reports a current time. Before seeking, note the current position (from the
  workspace summary or your last seek result); to undo, check whether the seek result actually
  contains \`previousTimeNs\` before relying on it — when it is absent, tell the user that the
  original position cannot be restored automatically. The player state backfills asynchronously,
  so the returned value is the accepted request — do not claim the playback head is already
  there.
- \`action: "play"\` / \`"pause"\`: no time needed.

## Finding the first error

To jump to the first error in a log topic:

1. \`search_messages({ topic: "/rosout", level: "error", limit: 1 })\`
2. \`playback_control({ action: "seek", time: <hit.receiveTimeNs> })\`

## Live sources

Only iterable recordings support \`read_messages\` and \`search_messages\`. When the workspace
summary line reads \`Source kind: live\`, skip read/search entirely — do not call them, do not
retry, and do not pretend the data was read; drive panels from the schema instead. A live source
returns a clear error — do not retry or pretend the data was read. Playback control may also be
unavailable for a given player; the tool reports per-action which control is missing.

## Time format

All times are decimal nanoseconds as strings (e.g. \`"1672531200000000042"\`). Convert seconds to
nanoseconds by multiplying by 1e9. Resolve relative times ("a minute ago") against the current
time first; never pass relative words or unit strings.

## Symptom-driven recipes

For "the panel shows nothing", gaps, wrong units, or broken timestamps, load the data-diagnosis
skill; it turns these three tools into step-by-step checks.`,
