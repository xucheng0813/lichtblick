MessagePath-based panel: **strongest constraint of any panel — the path must resolve to a
\`float32[]\` array.** Anything else — a plain number, a \`float64[]\`, an \`int32[]\` — renders an
empty chart. Do not propose this panel unless the catalog shows a \`float32\` array field.

Values are normalized to percentages of their sum. Slice labels come from \`legend1\`…\`legendN\`.

For non-\`float32\` distributions, offer \`Plot\` or \`Table\` instead — see the panel-catalog
skill for the routing rules.`,
