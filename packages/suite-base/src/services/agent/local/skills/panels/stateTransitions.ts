  body: `# The \`StateTransitions\` panel

MessagePath-based panel: shows how a discrete value changes over time. Same \`paths\` shape as
Plot.

Accepted values: number, string, bigint, boolean. A path that resolves to an array is invalid.
Best suited to enums, modes, and status flags — for continuous numeric trends use \`Plot\` instead
(see panel-plot).

\`\`\`json
{ "paths": [{ "value": "/nav/state.mode", "timestampMethod": "receiveTime" }] }
\`\`\`

\`enabled\` is optional here; \`timestampMethod\` should still be set. Panel-level \`isSynced\`
(boolean, default \`true\`) ties the chart to the playback cursor.

On recorded data the panel supports click-to-seek; on live data timeline navigation is
unavailable.`,
