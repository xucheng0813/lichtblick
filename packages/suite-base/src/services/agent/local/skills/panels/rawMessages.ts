  body: `# The \`RawMessages\` panel

MessagePath-based panel, but with **no type restriction**: any schema is accepted, and the panel
shows the full message tree. This makes it the fallback whenever a path cannot be built — see the
"never guess fields" rule in the panel-catalog skill.

\`\`\`json
{ "topicPath": "/nav/odom" }
\`\`\`

Optional diffing: \`diffEnabled\`, \`diffMethod\` (\`"custom"\` or \`"previous message"\`),
\`diffTopicPath\` (required when \`diffMethod\` is \`"custom"\`), \`showFullMessageForDiff\`, and
\`fontSize\` for display size.

The panel shows the latest message for the configured path; it has no per-message stepping.
For very large messages prefer the virtualized sibling \`RawMessagesVirtual\` (see
panel-raw-messages-virtual) — identical config.`,
};
