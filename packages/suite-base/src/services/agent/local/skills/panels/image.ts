  body: `# The \`Image\` panel

Topic-based panel: configured with topic names. It is the same renderer as the \`3D\` panel in
image mode; the difference is only which config keys are used. If the scene is a robot, read the
robot-viz skill first.

Configure under \`imageMode\`:

- Image topics: \`sensor_msgs/Image\`, \`sensor_msgs/CompressedImage\`, \`foxglove.RawImage\`,
  \`foxglove.CompressedImage\`, \`foxglove.CompressedVideo\`.
- Calibration topics: \`sensor_msgs/CameraInfo\`, \`foxglove.CameraCalibration\`.
- Annotation topics: \`foxglove.ImageAnnotations\`, \`visualization_msgs/ImageMarker\`,
  \`visualization_msgs/ImageMarkerArray\`.

\`\`\`json
{ "imageMode": { "imageTopic": "/camera/image_raw", "calibrationTopic": "/camera/camera_info" } }
\`\`\`

**Constraint:** without \`calibrationTopic\` the panel runs image-only and 3D overlays are not
drawn. Set it whenever calibration exists and annotations or projected geometry are wanted.

For a camera wall with several feeds, prefer one \`Image\` panel per camera in a Mosaic column.
For compressed-video topics, keep the number of simultaneously decoded video panels low — decoding
several video streams at once degrades playback.

See the panel-catalog skill for how \`Image\` competes with \`3D\` and the robot panels when the
user asks for a camera view.`,
