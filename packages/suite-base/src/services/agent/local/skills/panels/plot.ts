  body: `# The \`Plot\` panel

MessagePath-based panel: configured with message-path strings such as
\`/imu/data.linear_acceleration.x\`. The path must resolve to a value of the type the panel wants.

Time-series lines from numeric message paths.

Value types: \`bool\`, \`int8\`–\`int64\`, \`uint8\`–\`uint64\`, \`float32\`, \`float64\`, \`string\`,
\`time\`, \`duration\`. Fields that terminate in a message or an unsliced array are not plottable.

**Every path must be self-contained.** The \`paths\` array replaces the default wholesale; it is not
merged per-field. A path missing \`enabled\` is falsy and draws nothing.

\`\`\`json
{
  "paths": [
    { "value": "/imu/data.linear_acceleration.x", "enabled": true, "timestampMethod": "receiveTime" }
  ]
}
\`\`\`

Useful optional per-path fields: \`label\`, \`color\`, \`lineSize\`, \`showLine\`. Panel-level:
\`xAxisVal\` (\`"timestamp"\` default, or \`"index"\`, \`"custom"\`, \`"currentCustom"\`),
\`showLegend\`, \`legendDisplay\` (\`"floating"\`, \`"top"\`, \`"left"\`, \`"none"\`),
\`minYValue\`, \`maxYValue\`, \`isSynced\`, \`xAxisPath\`.

**Trap:** a \`value\` that parses as a number is treated as a horizontal reference line, not a
series. Use a real message path.

**Multiple curves:** prefer one Plot panel with all series in its \`paths\` array (one entry per
curve). Split into several Plot panels only when the series have conflicting units, value ranges,
or axis semantics that cannot share one panel.

**Trap:** a path that resolves to a \`string\` draws a line only when the string values are
plottable as discrete labels; for enums and modes prefer \`StateTransitions\` (see
panel-state-transitions).`,
