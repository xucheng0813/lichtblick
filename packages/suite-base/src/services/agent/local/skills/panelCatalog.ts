  body: `# Panel catalog

This is the router for panel selection. It tells you which panel fits a topic's schema and which
per-panel skill to load before proposing that panel. The complete live panel inventory in the
system context under "Available panels" is authoritative for which panel types can be proposed —
including runtime extension panels, whose schemas metadata is the authority for what they accept.

## Base every choice on current catalog evidence

Your evidence is the per-turn workspace summary and the catalog-ready injection. Prefer them over
memory of what a robot "usually" publishes. Call \`get_data_catalog\` **only** when:

1. The workspace summary was truncated (it ends with "… truncated"),
2. The topic you need is absent from the summary, or
3. You need a datatype's field structure — a field chain — to build a message path.

A large catalog truncates at a fixed byte budget, so fetch it minimally: one call per need, not
one per panel. When even the full catalog result is truncated, fall back to schema-driven panels
and \`RawMessages\`, and ask the user rather than guessing paths (see below).

## Two more skills to load

- Whenever a panel takes a message path (every MessagePath-based panel below), load the
  message-path skill for the grammar, the filter and modifier rules, and what each panel needs the
  path to end at.
- When the user reports a panel that shows nothing, a topic that seems empty, or values that look
  wrong, load the data-diagnosis skill before changing any config.

## How panels select data

Panels take data in one of two ways. Confusing the two is the most common layout failure.

- **Topic-based** (\`3D\`, \`Image\`, \`map\`, \`RosOut\`): configured with topic names. The panel decides what to
  do with a topic based on its schema.
- **MessagePath-based** (\`Plot\`, \`StateTransitions\`, \`Gauge\`, \`Indicator\`, \`PieChart\`,
  \`Table\`, \`RawMessages\`, \`RawMessagesVirtual\`): configured with message-path strings such as
  \`/imu/data.linear_acceleration.x\`. The path must resolve to a value of the type the panel wants.
- **No configuration** (\`SourceInfo\`): config must be \`{}\` except for the optional
  \`lichtblickPanelTitle\`.

## Schema name variants

A schema is accepted under several spellings. When matching a catalog topic against the lists
below, treat these as equivalent:

- ROS \`pkg/Type\` also matches \`pkg/msg/Type\` and \`ros.pkg.Type\`.
- Foxglove \`foxglove.Type\` also matches \`foxglove_msgs/Type\`, \`foxglove_msgs/msg/Type\`, and
  \`foxglove::Type\`.

A topic also qualifies if the schema appears in its \`convertibleTo\` list, not only as its native
schema name. **RosOut is the exception:** it matches its eight schema names exactly and ignores
\`convertibleTo\` — see the panel-rosout skill for the exact list.

## Matching schema and goal to candidate panels

The rows below are **candidates, not hard rules**: the same schema can feed several panels, and
the user's goal decides between them. "Available panels" always wins when it disagrees.

| Schema / field shape | User goal | Candidate panels |
| --- | --- | --- |
| \`sensor_msgs/Image\`, \`CompressedImage\`, \`foxglove.RawImage\`, \`CompressedImage\`, \`CompressedVideo\` (+ \`CameraInfo\` / \`CameraCalibration\`) | view a camera feed | \`Image\`, \`3D\` (image on a plane in the scene) |
| \`PointCloud2\`, \`foxglove.PointCloud\`, \`Marker\`/\`MarkerArray\`, \`SceneUpdate\`, \`LaserScan\`, \`OccupancyGrid\`, \`Pose*\`, \`Path\`, \`PolygonStamped\`, \`JointState\`, URDF \`std_msgs/String\` | 3D scene | \`3D\` |
| \`FrameTransform\`/\`FrameTransforms\`, \`tf2_msgs/TFMessage\`, \`TransformStamped\` | transforms | \`3D\` — but transforms alone never show geometry; there must also be a renderable topic marked \`visible: true\` |
| numeric field (\`float32\`/\`float64\`/int/uint/\`bool\`/\`time\`/\`duration\`) | trend over time | \`Plot\` |
| discrete field (number, string, boolean) | state changes / modes / enums over time | \`StateTransitions\` |
| boolean, number, or string field (scalar path; for \`std_msgs/Bool\` and similar use \`/topic.data\` — a topic root resolves to the message object, and the panel then shows only the fallback) | status light | \`Indicator\` |
| single numeric field | dial readout | \`Gauge\` |
| \`float32[]\` array field | distribution | \`PieChart\` — only \`float32[]\`, nothing else |
| object or array-of-objects path | structured detail | \`Table\` |
| any topic, no path needed | raw message inspection | \`RawMessages\`, \`RawMessagesVirtual\` |
| \`NavSatFix\`, \`foxglove.LocationFix\`, \`foxglove.GeoJSON\` | geographic position | \`map\` |
| one of the eight exact Log schema names | log messages | \`RosOut\` |
| nothing needed | data source context | \`SourceInfo\` |

## The two robot panels

Two purpose-built robot panels ship with the application
(\`Quadruped Visualization.Quadruped Visualization\` and
\`Humanoid Visualization.Humanoid Visualization\`). When a layout needs a 3D view of a robot,
**read the robot-viz skill** before choosing between them and the generic \`3D\` panel — the
quadruped panel is the default.

## Load the per-panel skill before using a panel

Before proposing any of the panels below, load its \`panel-*\` skill — it documents the exact
config keys, defaults, and the constraints that layout validation cannot enforce.

| Panel type | Skill to load |
| --- | --- |
| \`3D\` | \`panel-3d\` |
| \`Plot\` | \`panel-plot\` |
| \`Image\` | \`panel-image\` |
| \`RawMessages\` | \`panel-raw-messages\` |
| \`RawMessagesVirtual\` | \`panel-raw-messages-virtual\` |
| \`Table\` | \`panel-table\` |
| \`Gauge\` | \`panel-gauge\` |
| \`map\` | \`panel-map\` |
| \`StateTransitions\` | \`panel-state-transitions\` |
| \`Indicator\` | \`panel-indicator\` |
| \`PieChart\` | \`panel-pie-chart\` |
| \`SourceInfo\` | \`panel-source-info\` |
| \`RosOut\` | \`panel-rosout\` |

The two robot panels are covered by the robot-viz skill instead.

## Never guess fields or paths

Message paths are never validated — an unresolvable path surfaces as an in-panel error at runtime.
So only build paths from topics and fields actually present in the loaded catalog.

- When a datatype's fields are not visible in your evidence (the catalog lists a schema name but
  not its structure), **never guess a field name or a messagePath**.
- Instead, choose a schema-driven panel that needs no path — \`Image\`, \`map\`, \`3D\`, \`RosOut\`
  — or \`RawMessages\`/\`RawMessagesVirtual\`, which need only a topic name.
- Or read one real message with \`read_messages\` and build the path from the fields it actually
  contains (message-path skill).
- Or ask the user which field to show. A guessed path that renders nothing is worse than one
  clarifying question.

## Making a layout that actually shows data

Layout validation is deliberately permissive: a missing config field passes validation and the
panel falls back to its defaults. That means a layout can be fully valid and still render nothing.
Validation will not catch these, so check them yourself (each is spelled out in the per-panel
skill):

- \`Plot\` paths carry \`enabled: true\`.
- \`Plot\` / \`StateTransitions\` \`paths\` is non-empty.
- \`Indicator\` \`rules\` is non-empty and \`rawValue\`s are strings.
- \`Gauge\` \`minValue\`/\`maxValue\` match the signal range.
- \`Gauge\` / \`Indicator\` / \`PieChart\` \`path\`, \`Table\` / \`RawMessages\` \`topicPath\`, and
  \`Image\` \`imageMode.imageTopic\` are non-empty.
- \`3D\` has at least one topic marked \`visible: true\`.
- Every panel config carries a non-empty \`lichtblickPanelTitle\` (see the layout-authoring
  skill for the rule and its Table/RawMessages/RawMessagesVirtual exceptions).
- \`PieChart\` is only used for a \`float32[]\` field.
- \`RosOut\` \`topicToRender\` names a topic whose schema is one of the eight exact Log schemas
  (\`convertibleTo\` does not qualify).`,
