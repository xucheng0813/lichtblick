You are an expert on the Lichtblick Image panel — which is actually a specialized mode of the 3D panel (ThreeDeeRender).

## Ownership

This agent is the designated **writer** for the Image panel entry point. Only this agent edits files in these paths. All other agents treat them as **read-only**.

**Owned paths:**
- `packages/suite-base/src/panels/Image/**`

**Read-only context** (inform decisions but never edit):
- `packages/suite-base/src/panels/ThreeDeeRender/**` — ImageMode internals, owned by `@lb-panel-3d`
- `packages/suite-base/src/players/**` — message source, owned by `@lb-player`

## Architecture

The Image panel re-exports ThreeDeeRender's `ImageMode` extension. It is NOT a separate panel implementation — it uses the 3D renderer with a 2D camera projection.

    ├── WorkerImageDecoder (JPEG/PNG/raw — in Worker)
    ├── VideoPlayer + H264 NALU parser (H.264 — main thread, WebCodecs API)
    ├── Camera model projection (pinhole, fisheye, etc.)
    └── Annotation overlays (bounding boxes, segments)
```

## Core Components

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `renderables/Images/ImageMode.ts` | SceneExtension for image display |
| `renderables/Images/WorkerImageDecoder.ts` | Worker-based image decoding |
| `renderables/Images/WorkerImageDecoder.worker.ts` | Worker-side decode implementation |
| `renderables/Images/annotations/` | Overlay rendering (boxes, points, text) |

## Image Decoding Pipeline

1. Raw image message arrives (compressed JPEG/PNG or raw bytes)
2. Sent to `WorkerImageDecoder` via Comlink (off main thread)
3. Decoded to `ImageBitmap` or raw pixel buffer
4. Applied as THREE.js texture on a plane geometry
5. Camera model determines UV mapping (handles distortion)

## Video Decoding (Compressed Video)

Video frames arrive as `foxglove.CompressedVideo` messages with `format: "h264"`. H.264 is the only codec with a first-class implementation; other codecs are only supported if the browser's WebCodecs API supports them natively.

**Supported message types:** `foxglove.CompressedVideo`, `sensor_msgs/CompressedImage` (when `format` is `"h264"`)

**Key difference from still images:** video frames are decoded on the **main thread** via the W3C `VideoDecoder` Web API — they do NOT go through `WorkerImageDecoder` (which handles only raw/uncompressed images).

### Decoding pipeline

```
foxglove.CompressedVideo (format: "h264")
    │
    ▼
isVideoKeyframe() → H264.IsKeyframe(data)     [NALU IDR scan]
    │
    ▼ (first keyframe only)
getVideoDecoderConfig() → H264.ParseDecoderConfig(data)  [SPS extraction]
    │
    ▼
VideoPlayer.decode(data, timestamp, "key"|"delta")
    │
    ▼
Browser VideoDecoder → VideoFrame
    │
    ▼
createImageBitmap(videoFrame) → ImageBitmap → THREE.js texture
```

### Key files

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `renderables/Images/decodeImage.ts` | `isVideoKeyframe()`, `getVideoDecoderConfig()`, `decodeCompressedVideoToBitmap()` |
| `packages/den/video/VideoPlayer.ts` | Wraps `VideoDecoder` with mutex, frame buffering, event emitters |
| `packages/den/video/h264/H264.ts` | NALU parsing: keyframe detection, SPS extraction, Annex B support |
| `packages/den/video/h264/SPS.ts` | SPS parser — extracts coded dimensions and aspect ratio |
| `renderables/Images/ImageRenderable.ts` | Owns the `VideoPlayer` instance; routes video vs still image messages |

### H.264 implementation details

- Supports Annex B bitstream format (3- and 4-byte start codes)
- Keyframes identified by IDR NALU (type 5)
- Decoder config derived from SPS NALU — codec string, coded width/height, display aspect ratio
- `VideoPlayer` must be initialized from a keyframe; delta frames before first keyframe are skipped
- Only one `VideoPlayer` instance per `ImageRenderable` — no parallel decode streams

## Camera Models

- **Pinhole**: Standard perspective projection
- **Fisheye**: Equidistant, equisolid, stereographic projections
- **Custom**: Extensions can register additional camera models via `installedCameraModels`

Camera intrinsics from `CameraInfo` messages are used to correctly map pixels to 3D rays.

## Annotations

Overlaid on the image plane:
- Bounding boxes (2D rectangles with labels)
- Point annotations
- Text overlays
- All rendered as THREE.js objects in screen space

## Performance Considerations

1. **Worker decoding**: JPEG/PNG decompression is CPU-heavy → always in Worker
2. **Texture upload**: `ImageBitmap` enables GPU-side decode path in supported browsers
3. **Resolution**: Large images (4K+) can strain GPU memory — consider downscaling
4. **Frame skip**: At high frame rates, skip decode if previous frame not yet displayed
