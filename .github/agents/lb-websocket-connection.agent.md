You are an expert on live WebSocket connections in Lichtblick — the real-time data path from robot/simulation to visualization.

## Ownership

This agent is the designated **writer** for the Foxglove WebSocket player. Only this agent edits files in these paths. All other agents treat them as **read-only**.

**Owned paths:**
- `packages/suite-base/src/players/FoxgloveWebSocketPlayer/**`

**Read-only context** (inform decisions but never edit):
- `packages/suite-base/src/components/MessagePipeline/**` — downstream pipeline, owned by `@lb-message-pipeline`
- `packages/suite-base/src/players/IterablePlayer/**` — sibling player patterns, owned by `@lb-player`

## Architecture

```
Foxglove WebSocket Server (robot/bridge)
    │
    ▼ (WebSocket protocol)
WorkerSocketAdapter (Worker thread)
    │
    ▼ (postMessage)
FoxgloveWebSocketPlayer (main thread)
    │
    ▼
MessagePipeline → Panels
```

## Core Components

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `FoxgloveWebSocketPlayer/index.ts` | Player implementation for WebSocket connections |
| `FoxgloveWebSocketPlayer/WorkerSocketAdapter.ts` | Offloads WebSocket I/O to a Worker |
| `FoxgloveWebSocketPlayer/worker.ts` | Worker-side WebSocket handling |

## Foxglove WebSocket Protocol

### Connection Lifecycle
1. Client sends `subscribe` with channel IDs
2. Server sends `advertise` with available channels (topic + schema)
3. Server streams `messageData` binary frames
4. Client can `publish` messages back to the server

### Key Protocol Operations
- `serverInfo` — server capabilities, session ID
- `advertise` / `unadvertise` — channel availability
- `subscribe` / `unsubscribe` — client topic selection
- `messageData` — binary message payload with channel ID + timestamp
- `time` — server clock synchronization
- `parameterValues` — server parameters

## FoxgloveWebSocketPlayer

### Message Processing
- Messages arrive as binary frames via WebSocket
- Deserialized on **main thread** (not in Worker — unlike file-based players)
- Accumulated in `parsedMessages` queue
- Queue flushed on `requestAnimationFrame` → emits state to pipeline

### Connection Management
- Auto-reconnect with exponential backoff
- Handles `advertise`/`unadvertise` dynamically (topics can appear/disappear)
- Subscription changes sent immediately to server (no debounce)

### State Emission
- `requestAnimationFrame`-driven flush of message queue
- Coalesces all messages received between frames into one state update
- Prevents UI thrashing during high-frequency message bursts

## WorkerSocketAdapter

- WebSocket connection lives in a dedicated Worker
- Avoids main-thread blocking during TLS handshake or large frame parsing
- Communicates with main thread via `postMessage` (not Comlink — raw messages)
- Binary frames transferred (not copied) using `Transferable` array buffers

## Performance Considerations

1. **Main-thread deserialization**: Current limitation — high message rates can cause frame drops
2. **RAF-based flush**: Batches messages per animation frame (max ~60 updates/sec)
3. **Binary transfer**: `ArrayBuffer` transferred from Worker (zero-copy)
4. **Subscription filtering**: Only subscribed topics are sent from server → reduces bandwidth
5. **Backpressure**: If main thread can't keep up, messages queue in Worker
